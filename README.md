# malware_detection

# There are several implementation steps that are discussed below:

1. First, Perform data cleaning to address any missing values, or any null
values and duplicate values in the dataset.

2. Classify the dataset to identify how many bening and the malware files are
in the dataset. Analyze the distribution of the classes (benign and malware)
in the dataset. Determine the number of samples belonging to each class.

3. Feature selection based on correlation(Pearson's correlation coefficient) to
check which is highly correlated with the target variable or have strong
inter-correlations among themselves.

4. Drop some features based on correlation.
   
5. Data converted into correct format for the model using MiniMaxScaler.
   
# 6. Apply KNN algorithm on the dataset.
 # Steps involved in KNN -

  1. Initialize the value of K (the number of nearest neighbors).
     
  2. For each instance in the test dataset:
      2.1. Calculate the distance between the test instance and all the training
      instances using a distance metric (e.g. Euclidean distance).
      2.2. Sort the distances in ascending order and select the K nearest
      neighbors.
      2.3. Retrieve the labels of the K nearest neighbors.
      2.4. Determine the class with the majority vote among the K nearest
      neighbors.
      2.5. Assign the determined class as the predicted class for the test
      instances.
     
  3. Repeat step 2 for all instances in the test dataset.
     
  4. Evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm
     
# Achieving an accuracy of 99% in the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a significant achievement and indicates the effectiveness of the model on the given dataset.
